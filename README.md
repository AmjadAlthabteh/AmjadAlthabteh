Hey, I’m Amjad, I am a student who enjoys C++ 
Into graphics programming and all the rendering behind how things actually show up on screen.

I enjoy building games and interactive worlds — there’s something addictive about making something you can walk around in... and run.

Graphics is honestly one of my biggest passions. Cool things like pelines,, engine, also a full-on C++ enthusiast
